Although Americaâ€™s greatest muscle cars were built during the 1960s, Oldsmobile boldly experimented with the idea of putting a big engine in a small car when it released the 88 for 1949. On paper, the recipe was simple: it put the 135bhp Rocket V8 it designed for the 98 into the smaller, lighter 76 body. Its 12.2sec 0-60mph time sounds slow in 2020 but it was extremely impressive at the time.
